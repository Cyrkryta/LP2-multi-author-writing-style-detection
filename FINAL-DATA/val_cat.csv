"The platform, not that specific variation.. sorry… I should have specified. The genius of this platform is its loc cost components. It has been cobbled together from OTS components. I think this is standard operating procedure. Deny deny Denys and then deny some more. Even Murica does this.. according to the McNamara doctrine The funny thing is that they want public credit, based on this article, which is counterintuitive, given the fact that in military circles it’s undeniable . But since their drones are used by NGO’s maybe they want commercial clients with this horn tooting exercise. I would definitely consider their tech, it’s as close to sn open source drone we will get.(I remember reading that it has car parts and washing machine tech and the engines can be mounted in tandem).",0,medium

"“We were faced with the question: what about the women and children?–I have decided on a solution to this problem. I did not consider myself justified to exterminate the men only—in other words, to kill them or have them killed while allowing the avengers, in the form of their children, to grow up in the midst of our sons and grandsons. The difficult decision had to be made to have this people disappear from the earth.”. So no, you couldn’t argue that. They intended to kill them. They weren’t merely okay with letting them die, they actively exterminated them. You could maybe make the argument for other groups that were victims of the holocaust? But then the question isn’t “did the Nazis commit genocide” but “against exactly which groups did the Nazis commit genocide”.",0,medium
The first point of the Chinese peace plan says that every countries sovereignty and borders must be respected but nowhere does it state that Russia must withdraw from Ukraine. Obviously this leaves enough room for interpretation since Putin believes the occupied regions are Russian.,0,medium
"When all Asad used International Prohibited weapons, where were the US and the rest of the world? I can tell you. They were searching for oil. When we almost took down the Alasad regime and then Russia started having direct involvement in the war, where was the savor US? I can tell you, they were searching for oil. I guess my point wasn't clear enough. They are searching to fish in the muddy swamp called Syria. Oil here is just a reference to the benefits each side is seeking.",0,medium

Not really. He was rambling about not having a dedicated drone unit when we literally have one and had one since 2018.

"Reddit Revolutionaries love romanticizing communist propaganda but simply refuse to accept that the propaganda was just bullshit, the revolutions resulted in a lot of people being murdered by the state or starved and a couple of generations later its just capitalism in a more authoritarian state.

"Yes it is. Of course, if you enacted a policy that killed millions of people, you will have almost certainly committed a long list of other crimes for which you will die in prison. A large number of murders, if, say, you wanted them to die but not because of their membership of a national, ethnical, racial or religious group. I’m not sure what the international equivalent of gross negligence resulting in death is, but that would be a distinct possibility. Killing people because you just don’t care if they have enough food to survive isn’t genocide. For it to be genocide you have to deliberately reduce their number.",0,medium

(Letter shields him from looking incompetent, like saying poisoned from unknown source would seem.) However, given that 99% of poisonings are done by the FSB, they could’ve released that detail because they want investigation/revenge/turf war. (Also, typically, they poison multiple items, then send sweepers to collect/clean, so might’ve already caught someone.). Look, this is all about money.

"His ""ability to maintain good relationships with western powers"" is BS. He oversaw the third cross-strait crisis. The only reason you don't remember the times he disagreed with the West is because we never took China seriously as a potential peer competitor. Back then, we could silence China's disapproval of a Taiwanese leader with a basic naval exercise. Jiang and Xi's policies towards the West haven't changed, most of the change comes from the West not being as cooperative because it realizes China is an imminent threat to it's hegemony. Never thought I'd see the day where Westerners praise Jiang. Just goes to show how easily Westerners forget about the past to eat up the new narrative about why this time, China's leader is really bad.",0,medium
"Genocide is a crime which requires intent.

"This could be the breaking point in the trajectory of the war. If Ukraine is really ready to fight something more like a set battle, they should consider ways of softening up the enemy or making the ground muddier or preparing the event by starting the fight early with various ways of making it a very difficult path for Russia. The ground itself should be their enemy. Thinks like trenches for tanks to get stuck in, Patriot batteries to kill in-coming rockets, like the ""Surrender Hotline"" to get Russian soldiers to surrender and thus ruin their unit cohesion, those are the types of things to undermine and destroy any Russian offensive. In the Eastern fight Ukraine knows the territory and the opposing forces and is winning. In a direct assault on Kyiv it's also known, but it could be somehow different this time. That difference needs to be made irrelevant, if that's possible.",0,medium

"When the Ukraine war started they may have felt some basic sympathy for Ukraine. As they too suffered unjust foreign invasion and occupation. However the longer the war went the more absurd the situation became. There are ongoing major conflicts in Lybia, Ethiopia and Congo. Which for the most part the west has ignored. At the same time you have Western nations ( the very same colonial powers) showing up and shouting ""if you don't support Ukraine your arn't for human rights and democracy"". At the same time documents are coming out that the Dutch and French assassinated beloved leaders like Lumumba because they could have actually developed their nations.",0,medium
"Maybe you mean by academics? Well if you could find a genocide where all academics unanimously agree that would be nice. Of course, if you don’t, and proceed with the law, you will make it illegal for academics to agree with their own work, or to defend why they wrote it. Let’s say new evidence comes out which, unambiguously, clears it of being genocide. It was actually just incompetence or whatever. It’s illegal to admit you believe the new evidence. It’s illegal to ask for the law to be changed to reflect the new evidence, unless you do so in such a way as to make it clear you don’t actually believe this new evidence, you just want German law to reflect the evidence you don’t believe….",0,medium

Joe won because he wasn't Trump. 2022 played out the way it did not because Joe but because folks were pissed at the GOP over issues like abortion.

"The government is actually contractually restrained from doing a lot of the things that would help because of NAFTA or whatever the new abberation is called. Basically, our military has the engineering knowledge and ability but that would put the gov't in a position of competing in ""possibly lucrative"" projects. It's quite messed up as far as that goes. There are no easy answer, like I said above. I don't know if just throwing money at them and letting them keep screwing over their own people really is the answer though.

"The whole reason why the deal included Griner and Bout was based on division. Now there are two sides to the whole debate, Democrats who view it as a step in the right direction to help an American who was in need of help from their government and Republicans who see it as an issue that a black, lesbian, basketball player was traded for a lord of war. The trade couldn't have gone any better for Putin, he received an ally of the Russian government, the US received a citizen in need of help, and now Russian bots can push their beliefs against others they seem undesirable while dividing the US even further over an issue that, arguably, doesn't even matter to the lives of the average American.",0,medium

"Perry represents the Harrisburg area in south-central Pennsylvania, which has flown to the left in recent years. In 2022, Perry's opponent got very little national attention or money, and didn't have a big-time campaign. Perry only won by 7.8 points - close enough that a better-supported challenger could take him out. This district also would have voted for Trump by just 4 points. While I don't have the numbers in front of me, I believe Democrat Josh Shapiro won it in his race for Governor. It's completely winnable. But the way to win starts now. It means getting the word out about Perry and what he stands for - especially if you live in south-central PA. Don't wait for the Democrats to do it - take to social media and make a post. Talk to people you know. Start the momentum now.",0,medium

"This is masterful trolling by Big Gretch to the state republicans who are in a deep deep quandary after the Nov elections here. They even lost all college boards, it was a full blue tsunami in Mi.

Bolden was also the 3rd most voted in the recent election in Mi-who elects their state supreme's in a supposed ""non partisan"" basis.

"This will be the pivot. Watch conservative shock jocks start to shift support to a quote-unquote winnable candidate in DeSantis. However, what would be really entertaining was a party fracture over this. The Republican party has dogwhistled to the Trumpopulists for too long for this to go over smoothly. The party will want to push with all of their media power to get support for a more run of the mill Republican. Trump's ego will not be able to take this and much of his support base will not accept the pivot. Imagine if Trump runs as an independent/third party candidate, splitting the vote significantly across the entire country delivering the Democrats a strong win in 2024. As a purely uninformed outsider opinion, it’s almost better if the Dems don’t send him to jail, as this would not only make it easy for the GOP to select De Santis but also galvanise the Republican base.

"Anyone who has shot both will tell you a rifle is the far easier weapon to shoot accurately, and if your purpose is defense, why is having more rounds an issue? Without and even with practice, it is easy to miss. Not to mention it is easier to mount further accessories that benefit the shooter like an optic to quickly aim and a flashlight if you are in a low light condition. A pistol is most certainly not. It is the best thing to be carried because it is small, but it is less accurate, so you are more prone to miss and send bullets to your neighbors, and also harder to shoot, so you are more likely to send bullets to your neighbors.",0,medium

To give Trump credit: People have (abruptly) become much more familiar with how our government works since he became president. Who knew there were so many obscure quirks?

"Tge losses are tough to follow because each side has its own inflated numbers of the other and reduced numbers for themselves. Russia has 3 times the population though. That said, invaders always lose more. It's a fkn mess. Honestly this is very serious. A war of attrition favours Russia due to population size. This has happened basically like I thought it would.... Russia rush in but don't achieve decapitation strike western help and intel allows a counterstrike, but Russia digs in and galvanises its resources. They're talking 500k troops. If we use history as our guide then we know when Russia is at war they will not cave in due to troop losses, no way. My belief is this will get extremely serious. We are sending Serious weapons intel and money, and Ukraine are hyper invested and focused. Russia is also fully invested and about to have another push. Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if the Ukrainian line cracks soon. That said, Russia may not be able to capitalise on a breakthrough because of the weapons, supply, tactics and intel we send.",0,medium

"Don't think this will be another war... at first I thought Israel was invading Jordan but it seems like they want to annex part of the West Bank thats called the Jordan Valley, not actual Jordan. From the bit of research I just did it seems like Israel already controls this eastern part of the West Bank with mostly jews living there with the exception of Jericho and Al-Auja. So pretty much they wanna turn their unofficial control into official control by claiming it as Israel proper. It'll be condemned by world leaders but I don't think it'll start a war since Palestinians don't have an army and Jordan isn't being invaded. I think a lot of people, like me, assumed from the title that Israel wants to annex or invade part of Jordan. And given that most of this area is already controlled by Israeli forces and has a majority jewish population I don't see it causing a civil war either. Of course this is ignoring all the morality and ethics of the situation this is just a pragmatic view of it.",0,medium

The fact of the matter is that Xi needs a signature success to hang his hat on. All the previous leaders had a signature policy that they can point to and say that was what made them great. Xi was originally on the ""made China respected"" train with the Olympics being a success and a 'coming out' party for China to be a co-equal on the world stage. Between that, the yuan becoming a reserve currency, and China taking the lead on a number of international organizations it seemed that was going to be the defining thing.

"There were aspects of this that were both complicated and petty, on all sides. He was officially, at one point, King of Greece, which was a constitutional monarchy but did not have a merely ceremonial monarch at the time, and he didn't treat it simply as ceremonial, getting himself quite embroiled in political messes while being quite politically inept. Much of his life, even after being deposed, was heavily affected by political and diplomatic machinations involving him. There were significant impediments to him living a normal life, and in some sense, his grifting was one of the clearer options for him after being exiled. He was not simply part of the extensive worldwide royal-roleplaying community of descendants who style themselves with titles long abolished, keeping track themselves of make-believe lines of succession that, absent the decisive force of state power, inevitably end up splitting off into disputes that will never be resolved. On the one hand, at one point, he was stateless, with his Greek citizenship revoked because, the Greek government stated, he couldn't be a Greek citizen because he didn't have a surname. On the other, he chose to continue to be stateless rather than ever adopting a surname. He lost most of his possessions and property (personal, not just state) fleeing a rather brutal and regressive military dictatorship that could well have killed him, but it was also his political ineptness that heavily contributed that dictatorship taking power. He spent much of his life trying to force Greece to give him huge amounts of money, property, and possessions, but then when he was able to get some comparatively small amount of money back through the ECHR, the Greek government made a bizarre and petty show of paying him by taking money out of a natural disasters fund. He continued to try to insist on getting property back that was dubiously personal rather than former crown property, but there were always rumours that Greek governments refused to give many of these not because they went to good state use, but because many things had disappeared into the hands of the well-connected during problematic periods of Greek history (not just a royalist rumour, and perhaps even more common amongst the left, because the dictatorship was far/weird-right). He was a figure that was known throughout Greece, but was also known more as a target of mockery than anything else. He wasn't the only person to continue to call himself King of Greece long after he was deposed; many Greeks did as well in some contexts, only, not with quite the same tone of voice or meaning.",0,medium

"I think a lot of people have swallowed too much kool-aid and think Russia is itching to launch nukes. I do not think it a realistic possibility at all that Russia would commit suicide by going there. They have absolutely nothing to gain by doing so, and would lose absolutely everything if they did. And they know it. It's why they keep bringing it up; to scare the world into allowing their genocide of Ukraine to continue. As it stands, Russian nukes are working much better than Nato nukes. Because their deterrent factor is allowing this whole horrific ordeal to continue. Meanwhile, Nato nukes do not seem to worry Russia in the slightest. For exactly the same reason; they know that they are not going to be used.",0,medium

"Russia already sabotaged Nord Stream 1 once before the explosion took place, blaming technical difficulties. Gazprom started reducing the flow of gas to Europe after sanctions were implemented for the Russia-Ukraine war. They shutdown their pipeline to Poland in April. Then they reduced NordStream 1 flow to 40% capacity in June. They said it wasn't their fault, citing a faulty part from German company Siemens. Then they reduced it to 20%. By August it wasn't delivering any gas at all, while they claimed they needed a turbine sourced in Canada that presumably couldn't be released due to sanctions. No one actually believed that the technical problems warranted shutting the pipeline completely down. Yet Gazprom offered to start running Nord Stream 2 under a new contract instead (which would only be able to deliver at about 50% capacity). Germany balked at the offer and procured the turbine needed for repairs. Russia refused to have it delivered.",0,medium

"Amid the chaos of the Russian army’s initial push into Ukraine starting in late February, it took a few weeks for the Russians to deploy their extensive jamming infrastructure. But once they did, they began deafening and confusing the Ukrainians’ most sophisticated systems—in particular, their drones—in numbers that surely startled Ukrainian commanders. But it’s important to note where the Russians succeeded. If only to understand where Ukraine might need to improve its own forces. For a rare picture of Russian military competence, consider the Kremlin’s battlefield electronic-warfare troops.",0,medium

But they're paid pretty fairly for the work they do, whether it's one day a week or five. The funny thing is, the vast majority of them are extremely positive, optimistic, and grateful to be alive. There are varying degrees of cognitive disability among the group -- some are frozen in time at the age they had their accident, some regressed to childhood, and some are essentially unchanged -- but it's also coupled with various degrees of physical disability. One guy is essentially a terminator. He's made almost entirely of titanium and carbon fiber, has one eye, and a tendency to get super emotional about his life.

The point is, that racism is not the explanation for why Illhan, with her criticism of Israel, is shown the door whilst MTG is allowed to spread her claims about Jewish space lasers.

This irks me in so many ways and the failure to hold Trump accountable for his much different situation is what is going to cause a ton of chaos around Biden’s. The Biden situation absolutely needs to be probed but in both cases we need way more transparency and public education on what/if was criminal in either case. Trump has obviously engaged in criminal conduct in how he obstructed the probe trying to get them back and also lying about it.

"Not if the High Court trash that law, which it should. If it doesn't, then it would mean the government could theoretically delete the courts, legislation, and executive, and install a fascist theocracy with a king (to take an extreme example) with absolutely no legal mechanism to stop them. Castrating the High Court with no constitution or any other mechanism to rein in a potentially corrupt legislative will mean Israel won't be a democracy anymore--as far as democracy is actually defined, which requires: suffrage, 3 branches of power (judicial, legislative, executive) with separation of powers implemented, a free press, human rights to prevent suppression of voters, and as a KPI of sorts for how well it performs: the transfer of power.",0,medium

"Russian jammers soon were thick on the ground in the east. “With the concentration of effort on Donbas, Russia set up E.W. complexes with up to 10 complexes per [13 miles] of frontage,” the RUSI analysts noted. “Collectively, these complexes effectively disrupted navigation along the front and conducted direction finding to direct artillery and electronic attack against Ukrainian aircraft and UAVs.”.

Obviously not at the same level of the poor Ukrainians who have to actually live throughout the hell day in and day out. I honestly believe its way past time that nato actually steps in bc the only the west is doing is letting this scumbag get away with some of the worst atrocities that the world has seen in a veeeerry long time... From mass kidnapping on a massive scale to bombing hospitals, schools, cancer wards, gunning down innocent civilians standing in line to buy bread and ice, bombing their apartment complexes, raping women and children, etc... I could go on and on for days. I just believe we are at the point its time for the leader of the free world to step up and put a stop to this horrible shit.

I do think Putler is only playing the card he has left and that is saying he'll use nukes. But it's just a bluff. If he was going to do it, he'd already have done it. From what I've read from their leaked reports if they nuke Ukraine then that is basically admitting defeat if they have to resort to such BS like nukes. I say either literally give Ukraine the best of the best equipment that can use with much further range or put nato boots on the ground in ukraine. I believe the only way Ukraine should attack into the Russian borders is to retaliate from where a long range missile was fired then they should have the green light to fire back at said bases inside Russia. It's time to actually put a stop to this sick sorry piece of shit. Just imagine for one second, how many war crimes are in the occupied areas that can't be currently accessed.

"I just dont get this perspective. We should be setting the example for the rest of society. I was happy to see other medical workers who refused the shot get canned, they made the rest of us look bad. How can ordinary citizens trust that it is safe if medical workers who should know best are refusing. that is to say nothing of the oath that many of us took to do no harm. If you are infected and spreading the infection you sure as shit are doing harm. This is also why for as long as I have been in the field have had to get a flu shot or not be able to go to work. Nobody threw a shitfit over that, and it was going on for decades. Hell I had to prove my vaccination status for all childhood diseases several times during training, and for good reason. Nobody wants to get measles from an asshole antivax doctor or nurse in addition to whatever you are there for. This is basic infection control, just like washing hands or contact precautions for c.diff. We should be held to a higher standard. EDIT: sorry for “regione”, I meant region.

So finishing it ASAP should have been priority and the normal rules of capitalism don't really allow for decisions that just 'make sense'.",1,medium

On the other, he chose to continue to be stateless rather than ever adopting a surname. He lost most of his possessions and property (personal, not just state) fleeing a rather brutal and regressive military dictatorship that could well have killed him, but it was also his political ineptness that heavily contributed that dictatorship taking power. He spent much of his life trying to force Greece to give him huge amounts of money, property, and possessions, but then when he was able to get some comparatively small amount of money back through the ECHR, the Greek government made a bizarre and petty show of paying him by taking money out of a natural disasters fund. He continued to try to insist on getting property back that was dubiously personal rather than former crown property, but there were always rumours that Greek governments refused to give many of these not because they went to good state use, but because many things had disappeared into the hands of the well-connected during problematic periods of Greek history (not just a royalist rumour, and perhaps even more common amongst the left, because the dictatorship was far/weird-right). He was a figure that was known throughout Greece, but was also known more as a target of mockery than anything else.

They may continue to feed the meat grinder for much longer thinking that the west will eventually run out of ammunition and weapons to supply Ukraine. (Narrator: they won’t run out). Some truly believe they are fighting NATO forces, and the majority of Ukrainians didn't fight. So by that logic, “NATO will run out of ammunition” doesn't sound as crazy. What they don't realize is, for example, reports of Ukrainian army speaking foreign languages doesn't mean that they are fighting NATO troops. It means that a lot of Ukrainians know at very least English on top of Ukrainian+Russian(and that Russian soldiers have no clue how heavy Ukrainian accent sounds). Plus, the % of Ukr army which are foreign volunteers is pretty small.

With the Supreme Court's dismantling of the voting rights act, states like Georgia, that Biden won, could very easily wind up going for the Republican nominee just because of how many black would-be voters are unable to cast their ballots. And historically, the Presidential election has usually been a referendum on the state of the economy, if the economy is doing much below average or much above average; I certainly don't feel confident that the average American is going to think the economy is doing well in 21 months (heck, I'm not even sure if it's going to be debatable-- there is a non-trivial chance that the economy will be in a dark place by then). I dont think they're afraid beyond they know if Trump isn't the republican nominee, he'll run as an independant and since they haven't been able to win the popular vote in a while without being at war, it'll guarantee their loss.

My own grandmother comes from a small rural township, where the history books reports from the German's own loss reports; 7 casualties. In reality the Norwegians made a local stand there and was fighting house to house, forcing the Germans to burn them out. And the locals observed the germans taking casualties in the high 2-digits, then throwing their own casualties into remaining houses and lighting them up. Her brother was commandeered by the Germans to drive his truck with casualties to the fires. He made at least 4 runs with the back of his truck stacked to the roof with dead soldiers.

But for some reason it seems to be an abandoned district by the Democrats much like other rural areas I have spent time in.

These have in the past been used to buy expensive properties in London. The documents also show that just before he was elected, he gifted his stake in a key offshore company, the British Virgin Islands-registered Maltex Multicapital Corp., to his business partner, who would go on to be appointed as Zelenksy’s top presidential aide. According to the Panama Papers, despite giving up his shares, an arrangement was soon made that would allow the offshore company to keep paying dividends to a company that now belongs to Zelensky’s wife.

Thats longer....A LOT longer than any country had resisted the German invasions at the time. It took longer to occupy Norway than it did to occupy Poland and France. Both fairly large military forces at the time. There's also a discepancy in loss numbers. The Germans notoriously underreported losses. My own grandmother comes from a small rural township, where the history books reports from the German's own loss reports; 7 casualties. In reality the Norwegians made a local stand there and was fighting house to house, forcing the Germans to burn them out. And the locals observed the germans taking casualties in the high 2-digits, then throwing their own casualties into remaining houses and lighting them up.

Once they have the enriched uranium it is surprisingly easy to make a nuclear bomb. The hard part is the enrichment. They don’t need blueprints- it is pretty straightforward once they have the materials. Its a combination of materials and secrets. Nuclear technology is very much at the top of the “tech tree”—you need to be able to source basically everything from inside your own country. Gas centrifuges used to enrich the uranium require very careful engineering or they will shake themselves apart. They also spin very very fast so they make them from a high tensile strenh steel called marraging steel. If you can’t make or acquire this steel then you don’t have centrifuges.

"apparently my English is really bad, I will write through a translator. the T14 is designed for a different engine, a new one, this engine is not being built now, there are no factory capacities, there are no long-term operational checks, there is a rather large complexity in manufacturing and operation. also with the transmission, the use of Western aiming systems and night vision systems can not even be remembered. it is radically different from the tanks of the 70 series. The T72 is still in service as the main battle tank, there are repair plants and well-known engines for it. the fact that the t14 was designed and there was enough knowledge and strenh for it - I do not dispute, but there is no capacity to manufacture a commercial quantity, there is no time to create these capacities either. I know about the continuity of generations in the development and production of tanks, as well as any other equipment. But the T14 is not the successor of the 70th series. Due to corruption and massive abuse of state subsidies, the Russian army does not have these tanks in service, plus global production problems. This is another beautiful picture from Russian propagandists and a story about the Great Army. In the army, there are not even enough underpants with socks, not to mention the t14. They want to sell the tank abroad. With a selling price of 4 million usd it would be a disaster if it would spread on youtube how easily the ukrainians can take it out from a distance with a single javelin or something similar.",1,medium

"I mean India doesn't offer much rn and is riddled with poverty as well. I live in the US and actual developed countries are generations into the future compared to all of south asia. But The northern areas of Pakistan where Gilgit Baltistan is are some of the richest and developed areas of the country. India would have to become developed to the level of US or western Europe to be able to realistically overcome their patriotism and even then I doubt it. So the only way India is getting that land is by fighting for it and waging an offensive war through the karakoram mountain range, so never. and Kashmiris don't live in this region anyways. In fact even in Azad Kashmir, it's mainly Punjabis/Paharis that live there. So there is no longing by the people to join up with the Kashmir valley, in fact the Gilgit Baltistanis want their own province seperate from the politics of Azad Kashmir and Kashmir valley. So India doesn't offer much to Pakistan in any fashion to concede this territory. India has never controlled this territory and never will control this territory unless it's willing to wage an offensive war which comes with the risk of nuclear weapons hitting every major city in India. I think your pov on this situation is very limited and optimistic thinking 1) people will turn, as someone who grew up in the nation, 99% of the people are sheep and love the military (the actual entity that controls everything) 2) that even if they did turn they would go with India.

"Most of China’s population has never been exposed to covid and many old people are undervaccinated. So while the Omicron variant of the virus will cause relatively mild symptoms in most people, a large number of Chinese are still vulnerable to severe illness. The country’s weak health-care system is already under huge pressure. At a hospital in Beijing your correspondent saw elderly patients breathing from oxygen tanks on gurneys that spilled out into packed corridors and waiting rooms. Videos circulating online show similar scenes across China. There have been reports of patients being turned away from hospitals in smaller cities owing to a lack of beds. Officials say there are around 10 intensive-care unit (ICU) beds per 100,000 people in the country, well below what is needed. Medical staff are in short supply, too. A health official has warned that some regions are approaching the “critical point” in ICU-bed supply. But a hint of how poorly things are going can be detected in the actions of China’s supreme leader, Xi Jinping. When the virus was under control, Mr Xi was hailed as the “commander-in-chief” of the “people’s war” on covid. He spoke often about the need to persevere with zero-covid. Since cases began to surge, though, he has remained largely quiet, making only oblique references to the outbreak.

At best Russian goods constitute less than .8% of Brazil’s trade.

"While about a thousand years ago China did directly rule parts of Northern Vietnam as part of their control over this region, they eventually learned that direct control wasn't the best way to go about 'pacifying' the region. Over time, the tusi system was adopted instead. Under this system, certain tribes and 'tribal nobles' could hold certain aristocratic titles to their local regions and receive the backing of the Chinese state to maintain control. This was very attractive to many local tribal leaders, as they could use Chinese armies to crush their local rivals. While they would nominally have to be a part of China as a whole, they possessed an enormous amount of autonomy and could inherit their titles, something which didn't exist in China proper (officials might hold the same titles their parents held, but there was no guaranteed inheritance). Additionally, Chinese influence in this region was so weak that many tusi chieftains would often swear allegiance to multiple states at once, leading to border conflicts between other powers. The region of Southern China/Northern India/large parts of northern Southeast Asia, technically known as the Southeast Asian Massif but famously named Zomia by Willem Van Schendel and James C. Scott, is considered one of the least governable regions on Earth. Mountainous terrain combined with a tropical/subtropical climate and high incidence of diseases such as malaria made it very difficult for states of any kind to effectively rule this region. For most of modern history, the Massif was dominated by a coterie of very ethnically and linguistically diverse groups of people, who often lived in smaller tribes and communities. Because of how hard this area was to govern, many bandits and rebels in China (and other states) would flee to this region and use it as a staging ground to either launch a war or simply raid nearby settlements. As such, many Chinese Empires saw controlling this region as vital to their own internal stability. Additionally, this region also had a large number of copper and salt mines, both very lucrative resources in Chinese Imperial history (copper was used as the most common form of currency, and salt was a vital resource in the preservation of meats).",0,hard

"Caste-based discrimination is a serious issue, and I have never argued otherwise. We have endured a lot of hardship in the past as a result of this practise, so it is more than just a problem. But I don't believe that discrimination like this occurs in Seattle. There is no concrete proof of this claim. Sawant is promoting her unlawful caste proposal to target the South Asians. What should I do, exactly? Should I have to bring it up every time I speak? what do you want exactly? There is always the possibility that some other communities will have greater privileges than yours, and you may have to deal with prejudice there, which is something that happens more frequently. Where will this downward spiral eventually lead? Because there are more hierarchical structures than humans could possibly enumerate, discrimination between humans does not always result from community status, despite the fact that it is frequently the main factor. And based on the way you are speaking, I don't believe you want to stop this obscene tradition. You want other people to express regret for crimes they didn't even commit.

"There's an Engineering Explained video that debunks this. Even if you replace all vehicles on the road with EVs, and make them all charge every day at peak times, it's only 30% more draw than current. If you incentivize people to charge overnight or in the mornings by varying kWh cost based on usage, then the charging overhead needed for entire fleet replacement fits within the current infrastructure. Also realize that refineries take shit tons of power, so if those are not working as much to provide gasoline, then that frees up more electrons for EVs. I make 50k a year. Definitely not 1%. I just ordered a brand new Bolt. Why? Because my ICE Audi costs 35 cents a mile and I drive 25k miles a year. For the same cost as I'm spending on gas and maintenance, I could simply have a newer more valuable car (my Audi is worth about 6k now after 200k miles) and I can increase my net worth while consolidating my vehicle costs into one payment each month.

"""The last 10% is harder than the first 90%"" is an extremely relevant saying regarding stealth planes. It is comparatively easy to make a shape with a lower radar cross section, hide engines within the fuselage, use s-bends to obscure rotor blades, and reduce airplane noise. The hard part developing and maintaining radar absorbing paint cost effectively, transitioning from a design that uses low radar cross section techniques to one that doesn't compromise the cross section for other features, and carefully machining the components with extremely precise tolerances. The continued operation of an ""outdated"" bomber like the B-52 is precisely because the B-2 has such advanced stealth characteristics. The B-2, as a bomber, compromises different functions by maximizing stealth.

"If supply reduces people pay more money for oil, this results in the company having more money for investment. Or they pay money to share holders in dividends which drives the stock price up. The stock price going up means the company can create new shares and sell them while only reducing the stock value slightly. This money can be invested into its ability to expand supply. So more oil well exploration which can drive the price down in the future. If this doesn’t happen then the supply does not increase and oil price remains high which increases the cost of goods. Even if the government does a windfall tax that serves to reduce the amount of investment in oil, which may not be a bad thing because it makes Green energy more viable. The problem with doing that in the short term is that people end up unable to afford to heat their homes until you have the technology for heating reliably with green energy. You can subsidise heating costs but this makes factories have to pay more for energy which increases the price of products that consumers buy. You can set price caps but then you need to decide who gets to buy oil and who doesn’t because price isn’t the determining factor. You can increase interest rates which makes it more expensive to get debt which sends unprofitable companies into bankruptcy, reduces demand for labour which further reduces the money in the economy causing demand destruction. That does lower the price of oil but it causes financial hardship. Or you could do nothing.

"You don’t actually change the pronunciation, it’s just to closer transliterate the Arabic since the original word doesn’t exactly have a K sound. I explained more in another reply to the top-level comment. So the question is, since English doesn’t even have that sound, do you “simplify” it to English speakers by writing it as a K (generally the older way of doing it), or do you go for a more “faithful” transliteration by writing it as a Q (what’s usually done nowadays)? Personally, I go for using a Q, since Arabic also has the letter ك which sounds like a regular K, and using K for both of them introduces ambiguities. Even though it’s a use of the letter Q that doesn’t have a long history in English and can thus be confusing to some people, I think that as terms like Qur’an with a Q become more familiar to English speakers, they’ll remember without much difficulty that Q is pronounced like K in these loanwords. Although you do have to remember that this “Q spelling = K sound” rule only works for Arabic, and may not hold true for romanizations from other languages, e.g. Chinese, where the rule is more like “Q spelling = Ch sound”. (Oh, and the reason I write Qur’an with the apostrophe in the middle is because there’s actually a glottal stop in the word in Arabic, which is important in that language.

Just because the Ukrainians know how to use them doesn't mean it's the best option, sending Bradleys is the much better option. Exactly. I 100% agree. I very strongly support sending ATACMS to Ukraine, this is literally the perfect war for them. In most wars, the USAF would have bombed all the high-value targets long before the Army gets to them. ATACMS has a ""measly"" 190 mile range, while the USAF was sending B-52 bombers from the continental US to bomb targets in Iraq and then flying them back home. Even Tomahawk cruise missiles have a 1,000+ mile range. The Ukrainians already know how to use HIMARS and M270 GMLRS too. If we don't send them, then it was a waste of money making them if they never get used and just collect dust in a warehouse somewhere, plus it would be supporting the freedom of an underdog nation.

Three days before the election, Bannon met with Guo’s supporters and applauded their “editorial creativity over the pictures,” according to a recording provided to Mother Jones.

The Trump campaign had heard of the laptop during the summer, when a man from Delaware reached out to say that it had been abandoned at his repair shop. The first known public mention of it came on September 25th, from a guest on the YouTube channel of Wang Dinggang, one of Guo’s collaborators. The guest claimed that explicit material on the laptop was “recorded by the C.C.P.” and had “arrived mysteriously in America” to provide the Party with leverage over Joe Biden as he ran for President.

The China you know today has only existed for 70 years, though as they tell it, they've always been this singularly large country. China, industrializing as hard and fast as they could; in Xi Jinping's mind, a world where he cannot possibly imagine deglobalization, his world which we made on purpose, why make what you can buy? It's cheaper and easier that way. China does participate in chip fab, but all of it is imported, the tech, the materials, the knowledge, the software, the people. Because of Biden's CHIPS act, all of that is gone. And with that, all their supposed innovating that they were doing on high speed rail, for example, all their research, and principally because they decided to build hypersonic missiles so they could target the US if they had to, everything China has ever done to innovate is going to die along with their inability to get anything. They're sanctioned, and now they can't get the software from the US, they can't get the hardware from anywhere else, and the people they relied on were all US - so Biden said to those people, either give up your jobs, or give up your US citizenship.",0,hard

Note also in the real world EU has imposed many more restrictions on Russia, leverage from energy supply be damned, than China has. What I wonder is why they became so dependent on Russian energy in the first place when they should've seen this coming. France for example used to be heavily invested in nuclear energy, had the cheapest energy in europe and exported it to their neighbors and even they have moved away from that. Likely for political reasons. If germany and other EU countries heavily invested in nuclear 20, even 10 years ago this situation with russia wouldn't be so messy. Demand for Russian resources has made sanctions ineffective and allowed russia to write off(default on) their debt and finance this war by selling resources in rubles to BRIC and OPEC countries.",1,hard

"Then you threaten their licence. Ultimately, BP need to be able to extract oil in order to sell it. If one oil company is offering to play ball (and they will if they get preferential treatment) then you have leverage. If supply reduces people pay more money for oil, this results in the company having more money for investment. Or they pay money to share holders in dividends which drives the stock price up. The stock price going up means the company can create new shares and sell them while only reducing the stock value slightly. This money can be invested into its ability to expand supply. So more oil well exploration which can drive the price down in the future. If this doesn’t happen then the supply does not increase and oil price remains high which increases the cost of goods. Even if the government does a windfall tax that serves to reduce the amount of investment in oil, which may not be a bad thing because it makes Green energy more viable. The problem with doing that in the short term is that people end up unable to afford to heat their homes until you have the technology for heating reliably with green energy. You can subsidise heating costs but this makes factories have to pay more for energy which increases the price of products that consumers buy. You can set price caps but then you need to decide who gets to buy oil and who doesn’t because price isn’t the determining factor. You can increase interest rates which makes it more expensive to get debt which sends unprofitable companies into bankruptcy, reduces demand for labour which further reduces the money in the economy causing demand destruction.

Millions of refugees came because Serbians, Bosnians, Bulgarians, Greeks, Armenians… all wanted their lands ethnically cleansed from Turks. Who knows how many didnt make it to Turkey. No one talks about it. But the ethnic cleansing of Greeks from Anatolia, which shamefully did happen but triggered by the Greek invasion, is oh so much more important. Well thats wrong, the Greeks invaded to enforce the treaty after WW1 that granted eastern Anatolia to Greece. The Turks beat them and the British and French didn't help because they lost their own battles with the Turks. The Greeks then evacuated (depopulated) ethnic Greeks from Eastern Anatolia. Before that ethnic Greeks suffered greatly under the Ottomans.

Almost no one in Melitopol was clamoring to join Russia, but Russia needs it as a bridge to Crimea (the center of their conception of themselves as the third Rome). Russia wants Ukraine’s lands, they couldn’t give two shits what their people want. Putin cares about the citizens of Donetsk as much as he cares about the citizens of Kyiv. They’re both just lives that have to be sacrificed so he can maintain a hold of Crimea and his perception of himself as a modern day Tsar.

"The are plenty of permits where no drilling is going on. And refining capacity is lower than pre-pandemic levels so even if there were more oil from more drilling, this industry-created bottleneck remains. I believe a lot of this is because oil companies are refusing to reinvest into drilling and other production expanding activities. So like many other companies with a whole lot of cash flow (Apple) and nothing to buy they’re buying back shares. In part because of an adversarial environment for permitting and bleak long term outlook partially due to the Biden administration. So it’s a bit hypocritical for this administration to point and yell about share buybacks and artificial supply constraints when they’re doing everything to stop drilling. In the long term I believe it will probably be best to incentivize alternative forms of energy generation by making stringent and costly hurdles for oil extraction.

"So the question is, since English doesn’t even have that sound, do you “simplify” it to English speakers by writing it as a K (generally the older way of doing it), or do you go for a more “faithful” transliteration by writing it as a Q (what’s usually done nowadays)? Personally, I go for using a Q, since Arabic also has the letter ك which sounds like a regular K, and using K for both of them introduces ambiguities. Even though it’s a use of the letter Q that doesn’t have a long history in English and can thus be confusing to some people, I think that as terms like Qur’an with a Q become more familiar to English speakers, they’ll remember without much difficulty that Q is pronounced like K in these loanwords. Although you do have to remember that this “Q spelling = K sound” rule only works for Arabic, and may not hold true for romanizations from other languages, e.g. Chinese, where the rule is more like “Q spelling = Ch sound”. (Oh, and the reason I write Qur’an with the apostrophe in the middle is because there’s actually a glottal stop in the word in Arabic, which is important in that language. The glottal stop is often ignored in romanization because some languages basically treat it as “not a real sound”, and I think that’s stupid, personally.). Yes.
