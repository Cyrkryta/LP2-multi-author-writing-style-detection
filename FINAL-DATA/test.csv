Really, at the hart of any behavioral psychology is a philosophy of deprivation, negative reinforcement and the least effective positive reinforcement. Deprivation and negative reinforcement seem like the partners here, and they are at first, the real shit begins when you start rewarding your subject/patient. There in lies the rub. An ethical behavioral approach begins with earning trust and unconditional positive reinforcement. Deprivation is always a natural consequence: you throw your plate on the floor, your dinner is ruined. Negative reinforcement always takes the path of ""Your threw the plate of dinner on the floor and now you have to eat a sandwich instead."".",But what I have observed repeatedly is conservative people fucking up their own lives and ruining family relationships due to failing to accept another's sexuality.

"Here's a very simplified example. A household earning $500k in a year is considered to be a 1% earner. They would currently pay about $150k or so in federal taxes. That's approximately the same amount they'd pay under this proposed tax plan if they spent 100% of what they earned in the year. Realistically, earners at that level could spend 20% or less of their income under this proposal and still live very comfortably. That amounts to an effective tax rate of 6% ($500k x 20% x 30% / $500k). Any money not spent increases their wealth directly at the expense of middle class taxpayers, since the middle class will spend a larger proportion of their total income to survive. For example, a middle class household earning $100k would either have to spend 100% of their income to match the 1% example at 20%, for an effective tax rate of 30%, or to match the same effective tax rate of 6%, they could only spend $20k in the year.","No, no.

"I get that but that still doesn’t address my point. They authorize a bunch of junk, doesn’t mean it does anything productive. Anything that we don’t have money coming in from tax receipts needs to be borrowed. My point is the fiscal mismanagement of our government. I tossed out one example that will clearly get to $100 billion. How many other examples are there like this? What percentage of a dollar spent by the federal government actually does something productive for the citizens and what percentage is pure waste. There seems no accountability for where the money is allocated to and the utility of it. I’m curious how much waste there is. The military industrial complex is clearly a money generating machine for so many but that’s just one component, but a big one. Medicare, while very important isn’t financially well run and we certainly can’t have Medicare for all under our current broken healthcare system. That would only exacerbate a problem. The underlying healthcare system need to be fixed, screw the insurance companies, get the prices to something fair then work on a healthcare fix.

The sensitivity of global mean trends to outliers suggests that more informative indices are needed. We propose an alternative approach, which identifies clusters of extreme decline (or increase) that differ statistically from the majority of population trends.We show that, of taxonomic–geographic systems in the Living Planet Index, 16 systems contain clusters of extreme decline (comprising around 1% of populations; these extreme declines occur disproportionately in larger animals) and 7 contain extreme increases (around 0.4% of populations).

Reports were made by school officials and his pediatrician. Once police found him, at age 5, walking a mile away from his house down a state highway because his parents were fighting and he was scared and left. He was gone for hours and no one noticed. His parents got in a fight and were throwing things at each other; a mug hit him in the face and cut him under the eye. It was at least a year after these events that CPS was able to remove him. Now I am a teacher in WA state, and have had to make several calls to CPS about things students disclose to me.

This material can then react with water, creating a calcium-saturated solution, which can recrystallize as calcium carbonate and quickly fill the crack, or react with pozzolanic materials to further strenhen the composite material.

"It’s more complicated than that, in my opinion anyway. Productivity has been mainly driven by capital investment in technology, so should the returns of that investment accrue to the employee or the person who invested in the capital? Technology also creates new type of jobs, typically higher skilled, which do pay much better. For example, before the steam shovel was invented you might have needed 100 laborers to do the work of one steam shovel operator. The laborers might have earned, for example $5/hr. But if you add up their total wages it’s $500/hr. So you invest in a steam shovel at $100,000 and now you pay one person $50/hr. Total pay went down, but that one high-skilled operator is earning 10x what the low skilled laborers earned. There are also now people employed in the production of steam shovels. It’s hard to quantify all this, but the point stands that the value of increased productivity should not all accrue to labor - some of it should, but how much? There is also value being provided to the employee that is not paid. Jobs become easier, safer, more interesting. Digging with a shovel all day is back-breaking work whether you are paid $5 or $50. So the benefits of capital investment to the employee can’t be fully captured with pay. There is no incentive to invest in productivity-enhancing technologies if the benefits just end up getting paid out in wages.","r/politics is currently accepting new moderator applications.

Even less points within Ukraine that aren’t close to a NATO border would be worth hitting with a nuclear strike. The most likely use of nuclear weapons from Russia would be a small tactical nuke.

I’m certainly willing to give some leeway, But I do think it’s a problem when you can culturally raise your children as one thing and then suddenly they’re no longer eligible for membership in your tribe and the benefits that may come with that if you, say, marry someone outside of the tribe, or tribal membership requirements change as what happened with the disenrollment issues a while back. And I really think that compounds a lot of these issues around who gets to vote, whether it’s going to be based on region or if there’s some kind of special ballot or what not. I’m not gonna go completely into issues, but I guess if you’re curious, feel free to look through my other comment that I linked and bring up any objections or criticism any of y’all might have.","r/politics is currently accepting new moderator applications.

"""Recent analyses have reported catastrophic global declines in vertebrate populations. However, the distillation of many trends into a global mean index obscures the variation that can inform conservation measures and can be sensitive to analytical decisions. For example, previous analyses have estimated a mean vertebrate decline of more than 50% since 1970 (Living Planet Index).Here we show, however, that this estimate is driven by less than 3% of vertebrate populations; if these extremely declining populations are excluded, the global trend switches to an increase. The sensitivity of global mean trends to outliers suggests that more informative indices are needed. We propose an alternative approach, which identifies clusters of extreme decline (or increase) that differ statistically from the majority of population trends.We show that, of taxonomic–geographic systems in the Living Planet Index, 16 systems contain clusters of extreme decline (comprising around 1% of populations; these extreme declines occur disproportionately in larger animals) and 7 contain extreme increases (around 0.4% of populations). The remaining 98.6% of populations across all systems showed no mean global trend."".",Either the signs are too big for them to just dont do nothing or the bare minimum (what they already are) or the people push the change and looking at world I dont see it happening with so many dumbfucks letting themselves carried out by popular speeches of criminal idiots politians that dont actually do nothing and in the evironmental aspect even worsen things.,1,easy

">On Monday, the New York Times published an explosive story revealing that George Santos, a New York Republican elected last month to the House of Representatives, had made what appeared to be brazenly false statements about his background, including assorted claims about his business career. He had boasted of being an accomplished investor and financier who had worked at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. Yet each firm noted it had no record of his employment there. He had said he graduated from Baruch College. The school said he had not. His personal finances seemed odd as well, and he had worked at a Florida company called Harbor City Capital that was accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2021 of running a $17 million Ponzi scheme. Subsequently, he supposedly made at least $3.5 million from a mysterious company called Devolder Organization LLC that he started, that had no public profile, and that was dissolved soon after it was created. This marked a dramatic shift from his first run for Congress in 2020, when he reported earning $55,000 per year. The day after the Times story appeared, Santos took a curious step: He revived that mystery firm that he had claimed as the source of millions of dollars of income, and he listed as its address a Florida property associated with a former top official of the company that allegedly mounted that Ponzi scheme.","Hi trifecta.

"During the hot mixing process, the lime clasts develop a characteristically brittle nanoparticulate architecture, creating an easily fractured and reactive calcium source, which, as the team proposed, could provide a critical self-healing functionality. As soon as tiny cracks start to form within the concrete, they can preferentially travel through the high-surface-area lime clasts. This material can then react with water, creating a calcium-saturated solution, which can recrystallize as calcium carbonate and quickly fill the crack, or react with pozzolanic materials to further strenhen the composite material. These reactions take place spontaneously and therefore automatically heal the cracks before they spread. Previous support for this hypothesis was found through the examination of other Roman concrete samples that exhibited calcite-filled cracks.","Under closer examination, these ancient samples also contain small, distinctive, millimeter-scale bright white mineral features, which have been long recognized as a ubiquitous component of Roman concretes. These white chunks, often referred to as “lime clasts,” originate from lime, another key component of the ancient concrete mix. “Ever since I first began working with ancient Roman concrete, I’ve always been fascinated by these features,” says Masic. “These are not found in modern concrete formulations, so why are they present in these ancient materials?”.",0,easy

Part of the problem stemmed from the fact that Mosaddegh was connected by blood to the former royal Qajar dynasty, and saw the Pahlavi king as a usurper to the throne. But the real issue stemmed from the fact that Mosaddegh represented a pro-democratic force that wanted to temper the Shah's rule in Iranian politics. He wanted the Shah to be a ceremonial monarch rather than a ruling monarch, thus giving the elected government power over the un-elected Shah. While the constitution of Iran gave the Shah the power to rule directly, Mosaddegh used the united National Front bloc and the widespread popular support for the oil nationalization vote (the latter which the Shah supported as well) in order to block the Shah's ability to act.

Some vaccines are effective enough that the virus is killed by the body before the virus has a chance to cause the body to show any symptoms of infection. That is what immunity is. You are immune from the effects of the virus. Also, your body may be able to kill the virus before it can be transferred to another host.

Russia would naturally acquire a stronger natural ""sphere of influence"" around itself akin to the one US has with Canada and Mexico solely because of its size and economic growth, but its worst impulses would always be constrained through the presence of democratic checks and balances, and would be of a very different nature to the relations current Putin's Russia has.",0,medium

Furthermore, Chinese foreign policy has not made a friend in India, Vietnam, Japan, South Korea and even the Phillipines, hence of great benefit to the US. The US has the Chinese coast largely surrounded: the Chinese have only real long term security as of now in the interior of Eurasia. Even the Indian OCean is much less secure (via Myanmar and Pakistan), because the US is the dominant naval global power and India is right there in the region.

"Jesus was mainly a philosoper, and his teaching were mostly related to personal lifestyle (and arguably don't lead to a functioning society if taken literally).Christian norms are general (give everything to the poor, renounce to violence, love your friends and enemies, don't betray your partner), and you're not really supposed to always follow them: everyone is a sinner, everyone can be forgiven.Of course, absolutely evil things were done in the name of Christianity (because the bible is a contradictory and somewhat vague book and you really can interpret it any way you want with enough mental gymnastics) , but nowadays being a ""moderate christian"" living your faith on a personal level in a secular society is easy, because that's in line with the original spirit of the founder.On the other hand Muhammad was a succesful ruler and conqueror, his norms and rewards are far more precise and quantifiable (Give x fraction of your wealth to the poor, pray x times a day, go to place x once in a lifetime, you can have up to x wives, you will get x virgins in heaven) and actually define a functional model of society.","It may sound disgusting and sick, but stoicism and dignity in the face of death may sound preferable, but it only hides the true horror and Hell of those executions.

The sampling frames include RDD plus listed landline, RDD cell phone sample plus cell phone sample based on billing address to account for inward and outward mobility, and aggregated online research panels. Survey questions were available in English or Spanish. Phone and online samples were selected to ensure that each region was represented in proportion to its adult population.

Results are statistically significant within ±3.3 percentage points. There are 1,210 registered voters. The results for this subset are statistically significant within ±3.5 percentage points. There are 570 Democrats and Democratic leaning independents and 461 Republicans and Republican leaning independents.

"You don’t actually change the pronunciation, it’s just to closer transliterate the Arabic since the original word doesn’t exactly have a K sound. I explained more in another reply to the top-level comment.","So the question is, since English doesn’t even have that sound, do you “simplify” it to English speakers by writing it as a K (generally the older way of doing it), or do you go for a more “faithful” transliteration by writing it as a Q (what’s usually done nowadays)? Personally, I go for using a Q, since Arabic also has the letter ك which sounds like a regular K, and using K for both of them introduces ambiguities. Even though it’s a use of the letter Q that doesn’t have a long history in English and can thus be confusing to some people, I think that as terms like Qur’an with a Q become more familiar to English speakers, they’ll remember without much difficulty that Q is pronounced like K in these loanwords. Although you do have to remember that this “Q spelling = K sound” rule only works for Arabic, and may not hold true for romanizations from other languages, e.g. Chinese, where the rule is more like “Q spelling = Ch sound”. (Oh, and the reason I write Qur’an with the apostrophe in the middle is because there’s actually a glottal stop in the word in Arabic, which is important in that language. The glottal stop is often ignored in romanization because some languages basically treat it as “not a real sound”, and I think that’s stupid, personally.).",0,hard

Even if the government does a windfall tax that serves to reduce the amount of investment in oil, which may not be a bad thing because it makes Green energy more viable. The problem with doing that in the short term is that people end up unable to afford to heat their homes until you have the technology for heating reliably with green energy. You can subsidise heating costs but this makes factories have to pay more for energy which increases the price of products that consumers buy. You can set price caps but then you need to decide who gets to buy oil and who doesn’t because price isn’t the determining factor. You can increase interest rates which makes it more expensive to get debt which sends unprofitable companies into bankruptcy, reduces demand for labour which further reduces the money in the economy causing demand destruction. That does lower the price of oil but it causes financial hardship.",1,hard
