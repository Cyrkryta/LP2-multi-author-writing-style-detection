Mr. Vance had been intimately involved in our investigation, attending grand jury presentations, sitting in on certain witness interviews, and receiving regular reports about the progress of the investigation. He concluded that the facts warranted prosecution, and he directed the team to present evidence to a grand jury and to seek an indictment of Mr. Trump and other defendants as soon as reasonably possible.","""I and others have advised you that we have evidence sufficient to establish Mr. Trump’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and we believe that the prosecution would prevail if charges were brought and the matter were tried to an impartial jury.

"During the hot mixing process, the lime clasts develop a characteristically brittle nanoparticulate architecture, creating an easily fractured and reactive calcium source, which, as the team proposed, could provide a critical self-healing functionality. As soon as tiny cracks start to form within the concrete, they can preferentially travel through the high-surface-area lime clasts. This material can then react with water, creating a calcium-saturated solution, which can recrystallize as calcium carbonate and quickly fill the crack, or react with pozzolanic materials to further strenhen the composite material. These reactions take place spontaneously and therefore automatically heal the cracks before they spread. Previous support for this hypothesis was found through the examination of other Roman concrete samples that exhibited calcite-filled cracks.","Under closer examination, these ancient samples also contain small, distinctive, millimeter-scale bright white mineral features, which have been long recognized as a ubiquitous component of Roman concretes. These white chunks, often referred to as “lime clasts,” originate from lime, another key component of the ancient concrete mix. “Ever since I first began working with ancient Roman concrete, I’ve always been fascinated by these features,” says Masic. “These are not found in modern concrete formulations, so why are they present in these ancient materials?”.",0,easy

So the alternative for the North - and Scotland until the SNP - was to vote Labour. But the problem is. How do you convince the South East to vote for a Labour party when their public spending is already pretty good? Labour needs to run on a manifesto in the North/Scotland of improving our neglected public services. But they already get that in the South East. So they want lower taxes or even public spending cuts. They've got theirs screw paying for improving the rest of the country. So Labour is in a position where they can at best offer liberal or even slightly conservative manifestos to win an election. If they get to progressive then the Conservatives/right-wing and Liberal Democrats/Centre-right sweep up those South Eastern seats that they need to form a majority.

"I know you mean well, but the whole ""Apartheid state"" thing is part of the problem. It erases the actual problem (policies of the Israeli government that harm Palestinians) and replaces it with a national identity. Criticizing Israel's policies acknowledges that they can and should be changed. But if Israel is an Apartheid state, it cannot change while remaining Israeli; that's simply what it is. In other words, you have no recourse but to destroy the state. Which, oddly, also mirrors what the Israeli far-right claims (that they can't make the reforms necessary to ensure the Palestinians' peace and security because it would constitute national suicide) AND what Hamas claims (that they will not accept any outcome other than Israel's total destruction). It also erases the possibility of a two-state solution, wherein Palestinians have a state that is uniquely theirs, because in the Apartheid analogy, Apartheid was dismantled by creating a unitary south African state. But the historical context there was completely different (I could list the reasons but this is getting long-winded already); suffice it to say that it's a very round peg in a very square hole.","r/politics is currently accepting new moderator applications.

Between that, the yuan becoming a reserve currency, and China taking the lead on a number of international organizations it seemed that was going to be the defining thing.

"There were aspects of this that were both complicated and petty, on all sides. He was officially, at one point, King of Greece, which was a constitutional monarchy but did not have a merely ceremonial monarch at the time, and he didn't treat it simply as ceremonial, getting himself quite embroiled in political messes while being quite politically inept. Much of his life, even after being deposed, was heavily affected by political and diplomatic machinations involving him. There were significant impediments to him living a normal life, and in some sense, his grifting was one of the clearer options for him after being exiled. He was not simply part of the extensive worldwide royal-roleplaying community of descendants who style themselves with titles long abolished, keeping track themselves of make-believe lines of succession that, absent the decisive force of state power, inevitably end up splitting off into disputes that will never be resolved.","On the one hand, at one point, he was stateless, with his Greek citizenship revoked because, the Greek government stated, he couldn't be a Greek citizen because he didn't have a surname. On the other, he chose to continue to be stateless rather than ever adopting a surname. He lost most of his possessions and property (personal, not just state) fleeing a rather brutal and regressive military dictatorship that could well have killed him, but it was also his political ineptness that heavily contributed that dictatorship taking power. He spent much of his life trying to force Greece to give him huge amounts of money, property, and possessions, but then when he was able to get some comparatively small amount of money back through the ECHR, the Greek government made a bizarre and petty show of paying him by taking money out of a natural disasters fund. He continued to try to insist on getting property back that was dubiously personal rather than former crown property, but there were always rumours that Greek governments refused to give many of these not because they went to good state use, but because many things had disappeared into the hands of the well-connected during problematic periods of Greek history (not just a royalist rumour, and perhaps even more common amongst the left, because the dictatorship was far/weird-right). He was a figure that was known throughout Greece, but was also known more as a target of mockery than anything else. He wasn't the only person to continue to call himself King of Greece long after he was deposed; many Greeks did as well in some contexts, only, not with quite the same tone of voice or meaning.",0,medium

But even if they would formally be with us in practice these mostly corrupt and semi- or weak democracies wouldn’t be reliable partners, it an effort lost in advance to get the third world onboard.","It would be important if Europe held on with this war effort that Ukraine is sacrificially fighting for our interest, but particulary that our on-duty saviour, daughter-turned-parent: the USA holds this line and that trumpist republicans do not turn the policy around. Any outcome that would give Putin’s Russia any territory is a reward for the regime, a prolongation of the threat from Russia to the West - European Union, immediate russian neughbourhood that has aspirations to join the democratic world. This failure (in cost of life and resources) has radicalised Russian public even more and any victory they could take out of this would only worsen their mentality towards dangerous in future. The only way is defeating them so they realise they were fcuked by their leader. Their mentality will remain problematic but theere will be a possibility of self-reflection and preocupation with problems within the federation that would have to be resolved would kerp Russia out of our hair.

Yep but also the fact that Trump hasn’t been charged in his case despite literally obstructing and lying about it is what makes this even worse.

Trump’s claim, following his summit with Kim in Singapore, that “there is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea,” was either a delusion or a lie, and if the latter, one of thousands."".",1,medium

">This survey of 1,352 adults was conducted February 13th through February 16th, 2023 by the Marist Poll sponsored in partnership with NPR and PBS NewsHour. Adults 18 years of age and older residing in the United States were contacted through a multi-mode design: By phone using live interviewers, by text, or online. The sampling frames include RDD plus listed landline, RDD cell phone sample plus cell phone sample based on billing address to account for inward and outward mobility, and aggregated online research panels. Survey questions were available in English or Spanish. Phone and online samples were selected to ensure that each region was represented in proportion to its adult population. The samples were then combined and balanced to reflect the 2020 American Community Survey 5-year estimates for age, gender, income, race, and region. Results are statistically significant within ±3.3 percentage points. There are 1,210 registered voters. The results for this subset are statistically significant within ±3.5 percentage points. There are 570 Democrats and Democratic leaning independents and 461 Republicans and Republican leaning independents. The results for these subsets are statistically significant within ±5.1 percentage points and ±5.7 percentage points, respectively. Tables include results for subgroups to only display crosstabs with an acceptable sampling error. It should be noted that although you may not see results listed for a certain group, it does not mean interviews were not completed with those individuals. It simply means the sample size is too small to report.

And used an ultrasound probe which, you guessed it, had been cleaned with a rather strong disinfectant as we do between every patient which she had no reaction to. Then when we begin the procedure she has another coughing fit when we sterilize her skin, and this reaction I believe - it was a breast biopsy so obviously putting an antiseptic that close to her face definitely seems more plausible. She took another Benadryl and Xanax and tolerated the rest of the procedure fine. She even let us put bandages over the biopsy site, and adhesives are a fairly common material to be allergic to so you think someone that's allergic to quote ""chemicals"" would have reacted to that. After her biopsy she went to get a mammogram and, again, the machine had been previously cleaned which she didn't react to. One of our mammo gals asked if she would like her to apply some bactracin antibiotic appointment and her response was ""only if you want me to die.""

If that were possible, then the real question would become, what is the appropriate economic model for a world like that? For example, if all businesses had to give some % ownership to their city, more % to their province, and more % to the country (let’s say 5%, 10% and 15% respectively), would that kind of partial nationalization of businesses be helpful? The shares would be a special non-voting class that can’t be sold. Corporate tax would still be levied on revenues to give ongoing funding for Government programs, but each citizen would additionally have a tiny share of every business in the country, a slightly larger share in each business in the province, and a slightly larger share of local companies. As the collated dividend cheques come in, probably it would make people more business friendly and reduce nimbyism (not that that is a huge issue in China?). It also means that having more efficient companies and increasing automation would still benefit everyone, so long as total GDP is growing. The dividends would be paid to everyone over 18, and at some smaller rate for children, so their would still be incentive to work if you can still find a job.","Stagnate maybe but not dying, even if their population slowly declines in this century the wealth and industry they managed to build up in the last 30 years isn't going to magically evaporate.

The incident re-ignited calls for a leadership shake-up at the bank, where pressure has been building to make changes and ensure it responded to the climate crisis more aggressively. US Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, has launched a major push to change the way the World Bank operates to ensure broader lending to combat the climate crisis and other global challenges. Yellen issued a statement thanking Malpass for his service. The US will soon nominate a replacement for Malpass and the bank’s board will undertake a “transparent, merit-based and swift nomination process for the next World Bank president”.",">Malpass previously served as Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs under Donald Trump, Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary under Ronald Reagan, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State under George H. W. Bush. He served as Chief Economist at Bear Stearns for the six years preceding its collapse.",1,medium

Parts of western Germany were occupied by the French and British and war reparations levied as part of the Versailles Treaty were ruinous to the German economy.

"Hattusili's son, Tudhaliya IV, was the last strong Hittite king able to keep the Assyrians out of the Hittite heartland to some degree at least, though he too lost much territory to them, and was heavily defeated by Tukulti-Ninurta I of Assyria in the Battle of Nihriya. He even temporarily annexed the island of Cyprus, before that too fell to Assyria. The last king, Šuppiluliuma II also managed to win some victories, including a naval battle against Alashiya off the coast of Cyprus.[65] But the Assyrians, under Ashur-resh-ishi I had by this time annexed much Hittite territory in Asia Minor and Syria, driving out and defeating the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar I in the process, who also had eyes on Hittite lands. The Sea Peoples had already begun their push down the Mediterranean coastline, starting from the Aegean, and continuing all the way to Canaan, founding the state of Philistia – taking Cilicia and Cyprus away from the Hittites en route and cutting off their coveted trade routes. This left the Hittite homelands vulnerable to attack from all directions, and Hattusa was burnt to the ground sometime around 1180 BC following a combined onslaught from new waves of invaders: the Kaskas, Phrygians and Bryges. The Hittite Kingdom thus vanished from historical records, much of the territory being seized by Assyria.[66] Alongside with these attacks, many internal issues also led to the end of the Hittite kingdom. The end of the kingdom was part of the larger Bronze Age Collapse.[67].","no?

">At least seven different federal courts dismissed this theory until it landed in the 5th Circuit, the nation’s Trumpiest appeals court. In May 2022, Judge Edith Jones—a Ronald Reagan appointee and hard-right bomb-thrower—wrote a 39-page concurrence asserting that the CFPB is funded unconstitutionally. Four other judges joined her. Then, in October, a three-judge panel formally declared that the CFPB’s independent budget mechanism renders the entire agency unconstitutional. Judge Cory Wilson, writing for the panel, revoked the CFPB’s ability to issue or enforce any regulations. (All three members of the panel were appointed by Donald Trump.) Thus, under the current law of the 5th Circuit, the CFPB effectively does not exist.","I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.",1,medium

"The region of Southern China/Northern India/large parts of northern Southeast Asia, technically known as the Southeast Asian Massif but famously named Zomia by Willem Van Schendel and James C. Scott, is considered one of the least governable regions on Earth. Mountainous terrain combined with a tropical/subtropical climate and high incidence of diseases such as malaria made it very difficult for states of any kind to effectively rule this region. For most of modern history, the Massif was dominated by a coterie of very ethnically and linguistically diverse groups of people, who often lived in smaller tribes and communities. Because of how hard this area was to govern, many bandits and rebels in China (and other states) would flee to this region and use it as a staging ground to either launch a war or simply raid nearby settlements. As such, many Chinese Empires saw controlling this region as vital to their own internal stability. Additionally, this region also had a large number of copper and salt mines, both very lucrative resources in Chinese Imperial history (copper was used as the most common form of currency, and salt was a vital resource in the preservation of meats).","Historically Chinese empires viewed their frontiers as areas of vital national importance.

Personally, I go for using a Q, since Arabic also has the letter ك which sounds like a regular K, and using K for both of them introduces ambiguities. Even though it’s a use of the letter Q that doesn’t have a long history in English and can thus be confusing to some people, I think that as terms like Qur’an with a Q become more familiar to English speakers, they’ll remember without much difficulty that Q is pronounced like K in these loanwords. Although you do have to remember that this “Q spelling = K sound” rule only works for Arabic, and may not hold true for romanizations from other languages, e.g. Chinese, where the rule is more like “Q spelling = Ch sound”. (Oh, and the reason I write Qur’an with the apostrophe in the middle is because there’s actually a glottal stop in the word in Arabic, which is important in that language.

"If supply reduces people pay more money for oil, this results in the company having more money for investment. Or they pay money to share holders in dividends which drives the stock price up.

The problem with doing that in the short term is that people end up unable to afford to heat their homes until you have the technology for heating reliably with green energy.

You can set price caps but then you need to decide who gets to buy oil and who doesn’t because price isn’t the determining factor.

"Then you threaten their licence. Ultimately, BP need to be able to extract oil in order to sell it. If one oil company is offering to play ball (and they will if they get preferential treatment) then you have leverage.","If supply reduces people pay more money for oil, this results in the company having more money for investment. Or they pay money to share holders in dividends which drives the stock price up. The stock price going up means the company can create new shares and sell them while only reducing the stock value slightly. This money can be invested into its ability to expand supply. So more oil well exploration which can drive the price down in the future. If this doesn’t happen then the supply does not increase and oil price remains high which increases the cost of goods. Even if the government does a windfall tax that serves to reduce the amount of investment in oil, which may not be a bad thing because it makes Green energy more viable. The problem with doing that in the short term is that people end up unable to afford to heat their homes until you have the technology for heating reliably with green energy. You can subsidise heating costs but this makes factories have to pay more for energy which increases the price of products that consumers buy. You can set price caps but then you need to decide who gets to buy oil and who doesn’t because price isn’t the determining factor. You can increase interest rates which makes it more expensive to get debt which sends unprofitable companies into bankruptcy, reduces demand for labour which further reduces the money in the economy causing demand destruction. That does lower the price of oil but it causes financial hardship.",1,hard

"Yes that’s true. Unfortunately it can be hard to find a wide variety of native species. If you’re in the Midwest, there is Prairie Nursery that ships plants. Also Prairie Moon nursery. You can always search for native nurseries in your area. I’m also lucky to have a farmer at our local farmers market who sells wildflower seeds that he collects from his property. And thankfully, the trend has been moving toward people wanting more native plants, and growers and nurseries are realizing the trends. I’d welcome others adding any native plant sources they know if.","Plant native plants in your garden. Specifically keystone species like Native oak trees. Remove a section of your lawn. which is a monoculture anyway. Dead zone for insects. Stop spraying pesticides, Add native pollinator plants! We all can make a difference. I live in an urban area with less than .2 of an acre. However, I have bees, butterflies ,birds flying around. Eating the seeds, berries, insects. My neighbors who only have a few non native foundation plants and who maintain a lawn. Have barely any life in there yards. Be proud of your area, and incorporate life.
