101,3831,"You don’t actually change the pronunciation, it’s just to closer transliterate the Arabic since the original word doesn’t exactly have a K sound. I explained more in another reply to the top-level comment.","So the question is, since English doesn’t even have that sound, do you “simplify” it to English speakers by writing it as a K (generally the older way of doing it), or do you go for a more “faithful” transliteration by writing it as a Q (what’s usually done nowadays)? Personally, I go for using a Q, since Arabic also has the letter ك which sounds like a regular K, and using K for both of them introduces ambiguities. Even though it’s a use of the letter Q that doesn’t have a long history in English and can thus be confusing to some people, I think that as terms like Qur’an with a Q become more familiar to English speakers, they’ll remember without much difficulty that Q is pronounced like K in these loanwords. Although you do have to remember that this “Q spelling = K sound” rule only works for Arabic, and may not hold true for romanizations from other languages, e.g. Chinese, where the rule is more like “Q spelling = Ch sound”. (Oh, and the reason I write Qur’an with the apostrophe in the middle is because there’s actually a glottal stop in the word in Arabic, which is important in that language.
